    During my time at ENISo I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at the university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *ENISO Enterpreneurship Club* taking on roles such as organizing events and helping out with seminars and trainings.
